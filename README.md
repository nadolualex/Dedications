## Romanian Manelist Dedications Simulator

This project implements a simulator for dedications inspired by the Romanian manelist tradition, serving as the second homework assignment for the IOCLA (Computer Systems Architecture and Low-Level Programming) course.

### Description

The Romanian manele music genre often involves individuals giving dedications to musicians, requesting specific songs or conveying messages. This simulator replicates this cultural phenomenon, allowing users to interact with a dedication system.

### Key Features

- **Dynamic Data Structures:** Utilizes dynamic memory allocation and data structures such as structs to manage dedication requests efficiently.
- **Diverse Data Types:** Supports multiple data types for dedications, including different integer sizes and string inputs.
- **Dedication Management:** Enables users to add, delete, and search dedications within the simulated environment.
- **Interactive Console Interface:** Provides a user-friendly console interface for inputting commands and interacting with dedication functionalities.
- **Learning Objectives:** This project aids in understanding low-level programming concepts, including memory management, data structures, and input/output operations.

### Usage

1. **Insert Dedication:** Use the `insert` command followed by dedication details to add a new dedication to the system.
2. **Print Dedications:** Enter `print` to display all existing dedications stored in the system.
3. **Find Dedication:** Utilize the `find` command followed by the dedication index to retrieve specific dedications.
4. **Delete Dedication:** Remove a dedication by specifying its index with the `delete_at` command.
5. **Insert Dedication at Index:** Add a dedication at a specific index using the `insert_at` command.

### Acknowledgment

Completing this project has provided valuable insights into low-level programming concepts and data structure manipulation. By simulating the Romanian manelist dedication tradition, this project combines cultural relevance with practical programming exercises.
